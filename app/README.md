# Playlistd

[Playlistd](https://playlistd.herokuapp.com/) is a 3rd party web app built on top of spotify api to help you with making playlists.
* On the _Index Page_ you can see your music taste summerised (a mini Spotify Wrapped!).
* On _Make Playlist_ section you are given your Recently Played songs and Liked songs, you can add them to your
playlists(existing or new).
* When you click on _Add to playlist_ button anywhere on the website, you are taken to a page where you can see
a list of 5 songs with a checkbox to unselect them (they are all selected by default), you can click on _show more_ link to get 5 more songs(upto 50)
* When desired songs selected click on _Add to Playlist_ then select your playlist or make a new one and voila songs are added to your playlist.
* If you want to remove songs from a playlist, head over to _edit playlist_ section.
* _explore_ section shows you public playlists of all people that have used this app, you can listen to them
and like them (this section is not available in the online version)

This project was made as a Final Project for CS50 Web Development with Python and Javascript
